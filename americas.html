<h3>Central America</h3>
<p>Ranging from the southern tip of Mexico to Panama, Central American coffees are known for their classic mild and bright flavor profiles.  These coffees are grown high in elevation and are mostly made up of Bourbon (Bur-Bone), Typica, and Caturra varieties. As the vast majority of coffees are processed utilizing the washed method, these coffees are often distinguished by bright acidity, round body and a clean finish. While each coffee has a unique flavor profile, fruits like citrus and berries can be present with the sweetness of chocolate and nuts lingering in the background. Central American coffees are some of our favorite coffees to drink. 
</p>

<h3> South America</h3>
<p>
While Brazil and Colombia are the two South American coffee producing powerhouses, coffee can also be grown in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador. Generally speaking, coffees from South America tend to be slightly lower in elevation than their Central counterparts, resulting in coffees with slightly more body and less acidity. Mondo Novo, Bourbon, Caturra, and Typica are the most widely planted varieties found in South America. Typically, we associate South American coffees with a wide range of flavors, from bittersweet chocolate and earthiness to dark cherries and nuts.
