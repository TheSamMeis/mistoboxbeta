Dutch colonists first brought coffee to Indonesia after smuggling it out of Africa in the late 17th century. They first brought it to the island of Java and it spread quickly thereafter. While coffee is grown in parts of Southeast Asia, the best coffees from this area come from the Indonesian archipelago and Papua New Guinea. This area is distinct from other coffee producing regions as they sit at relatively low altitude due to the island geography, and domestic cultivation of coffee is considered more of a cash crop grown in backyard gardens as opposed to large farms or estates. These coffees generally emphasize body and mouthfeel with intense earthiness, while acidity and bright fruit notes are virtually nowhere to be found.

Indonesia has a reputation for being one of the most intriguing and unique regions in the world. Most coffee is grown in small backyard gardens here. When coffee is ripe, it is harvested and immediately depulped in home pulping machines, removing the skin and some of the fruit. The parchment coffee is then taken to a market and sold to a local mill to finish the processing. This processing technique called semi-washed and is one of the major reasons why Indonesian coffees are so unique. Indonesian coffees are generally known for very low acidity, heavy body and distinctly earthy flavors.

			<h3>Sumatra</h3>
			<p>
					Sumatra is probably the most recognized producing region from Indonesia. Coffees from this island are intensely earthy, with notes of tobacco, spice and leather, the body is heavy and almost syrupy and the acidity is only faintly present. Fans of heavy mouthfeel and intense flavors will want to explore coffees from here.

			<h3>Sulawesi</h3>
			<p>
					Coffees from Sulawesi are a bit more refined than their Sumatran counterparts. These coffees are a bit more herbacious, with notes of peppers and herbs and can be bit more savory, with a somewhat honeyed sweetness.

			<h3>Java</h3>
			<p>
					The origin of one of coffee's many nicknames, 'Java' actually refers to an island in the Indonesian archipelago. The coffee history here is rich, as Dutch colonists first brought coffee cultivation to Java in the late 17th century. Unlike other Indonesian coffee, most coffee here is processed via the washed method. This produces a cleaner cup, with slightly more acidity and sweeter flavors.

			<h3>Papua New Guinea </h3>
			<p>
					While the country Papua New Guinea shares an island with Indonesia, its coffees are fairly different than other Indonesians. Most coffee here is washed, and thusly the coffees are brighter, lighter and cleaner than their Indonesian counterparts. Look for mild acidity and a round but clean body.
