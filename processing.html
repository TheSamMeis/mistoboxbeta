	Processing Methods

The goal of processing coffee is to remove the outer layers of the cherry to make the seed ready for roasting. Each processing method removes these outer layers at different stages of the process and will play an important role in how the coffee will taste.

 
(Create image like these demonstrating process)

 
Seed - Often referred to as a bean, made of wood cellulose structure

Silver Skin - Thin tissue paper like layer surrounding the seed that comes off during roasting, referred to as chaff.

Parchment - Protective layer surrounding seed

Fruit/Pulp/Mucilage – If the fruit is removed completely in early stages of processing, it will result in crisper, cleaner coffees, if left on to dry, it can add fruity and sometimes earthy characteristics

Outer Skin –
What are the three methods?

•Washed (sometimes called Wet Process)
-Makes up the majority of specialty coffee. The majority of coffees from Central America, South America and Africa are washed. Certain areas in Asia/Pacific use this method, like Java and Sulawesi.

•Full Natural (sometimes called Dry Process)
-Used predominantly in Ethiopia, Yemen, and Brazil

•Hybrids - Semi-Washed & Pulp Natural
-Used most commonly in Indonesia and the Asia/pacific region, and Brazil, though new hybrid methods like Honey/Miel are gaining traction in Central America (namely Costa Rica)


What determines how a coffee will be processed?
Industrial development, access to water/electricity/equipment, tradition



Washed Method 

Coffees are put in large tanks of water for density sorting. Cherries that sink are ripe; cherries on the surface, called floaters are under-ripe, overripe or defective and are skimmed off the top before the ripe ones are moved to the pulper to remove the outer skin and some of the fruity mucilage layer.

Once the coffee has been pulped, it needs to ferment.
The fermentation process varies widely depending on where the coffee is grown. In Latin America, many wet-mills will ferment the coffee submerged in water in large vats for 12-36 hours. In Kenya, however, many mills will let the pulped coffee sit in the open air to ferment. During this time, microbial organisms and enzymes from the environment will descend upon the fruit, and begin to break it down so it is easier to remove. 

Once fermentation is complete, the coffee in parchment is moved to a washing tank where they will wash any remaining mucilage off. Sometimes they will let the parchment soak again to create uniform moisture content in the coffee. 

Once washing is complete, it is time to dry it. This can be done a number of ways and also depends on where the coffee is grown.

The parchment can be dried in the sun on a patio or on raised beds for even drying. The coffee must be raked and turned regularly to avoid rotting or uneven drying. This process usually takes about 7-10 days to complete. 

Farmers can also use a mechanical dryer, utilizing low heat to slowly dry the coffee.

Once pulping, fermentation, washing and drying are complete, the parchment coffee needs to stabilize. This is done by bagging the coffee in large burlap bags and letting it rest for up to 2 months. 

After resting or “reposado”, the coffee must be dry milled or “hulled”. This process involves removing the parchment layer and getting down to the green coffee. This is done using large machines that break the parchment layer off and separate the green coffee out. 

It is now time to bag the coffee. It can be bagged in fresh burlap bags, called “jute”, or these bags can be lined with plastic to help keep the coffee fresher and protect it during transport. This is called “grain-pro”. A newer technique that can prolong the shelf life of green coffee is to store it in vaccum sealed bags.


Characteristics of Washed Coffees 
Clean, crisp, bright, light bodied, refined flavor profile

Fruits like apples, citrus (lemon, orange), berries (blueberry, strawberry); milk/bittersweet chocolate, nuts are commonly associated flavors 



Full Natural Method

This is the original processing method, at the most basic level. Been done for centuries in Ethiopia and Yemen. 

This process requires less resources i.e, water, electricity but much more time and labor intensive to sort for high quality coffees because of lack of water separation of defects, so although it uses little natural resources and involves very few steps, it is labor/time-costly to sort well and can produce very inconsistent roasts and can contain lots of defects

Once coffee is harvested, it is immediately laid out to dry.

This process can take up to a month and must be meticulously observed and rotated so that cherries do not over ferment, spoil or dry unevenly. 

This can be done on patios or on raised beds. Patio dried coffee must be rotated more frequently, but can allow farmers to dry more coffee simultaneously. The extra airflow of raised beds helps dry all the cherries uniformly, reducing the need to rotate as frequently to avoid mold, mildew and rotting, but can be harder to dry as much coffee.

After drying, the coffee must be hulled to remove the dried skin, fruit and parchment layers. 

Benefits of natural method: when carefully sorted, natural coffees can be exceptionally sweet, balanced and heavily fruited. 

Potential disadvantages: it is time intensive to rotate the cherries and sort the green coffee for defects. If done incorrectly, you risk spoiling the entire harvest.

Characteristics of Full Naturals
Can be heavy or dirty, sometimes the acidity can be muted

Lots of winey/dark fruits (black currant, raisin, cherries), warm/baking spices (nutmeg, cardamom, anise), raw cacao (bitter chocolate), earthy


Hybrid Methods

There are two main camps of hybrids processes:

Pulped Natural & Semi-Washed

These are hybrid methods because they employ techniques borrowed from both the washed and natural processes to strip a coffee cherry of its layers. 

The Pulped Natural method is native to Brazil and is the most commonly found hybrid method in the Americas.

Semi-Washed coffees can be found in Asia/Pacific region, predominantly in Indonesia.

While both methods are similar, there are some key distinctions between the two. Both methods employ use of a pulper, removing the outer skin and some of the fruity mucilage layer. This is where the two methods diverge.

In the semi-washed method, the coffee in parchment is partially dried then wet-hulled, meaning that they remove the parchment layer before fully dried, to reveal a swollen seed, that appears to be white in color. The exposed seed is then fully dried and turns to a deep blue-ish hue. The coffee is now ready to be exported.

The pulped natural method – Once the coffee is pulped, it is ready to be dried. Often times, the farmers will allow the parchment to dry completely before bagging the coffee in parchment to rest and then remove the parchment by hulling. Once hulled this coffee is ready to be bagged and exported.

Benefits of Hybrid methods: Cost effective for small farmers. Creates an interesting flavor profile if done properly and meticulously. 

Disadvantages: Can create funky flavors, can lower coffee quality. 

Characteristics of Hybrid methods
Semi – washed coffees tend to have very low, muted acidity, full/heavy/round body, and intensely earthy, spicy and herbaceous flavors. Known for being “dirty”, lacking clarity

Pulped Natural coffees also have a more muted acidity and fuller body. They flavors range from sweet fruits and chocolate to nutty and earthy flavors.
