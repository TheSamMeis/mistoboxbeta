		     The coffee plant can only be grown in a tropical climate and requires specific weather patterns and elevation to produce coffee of high quality. Thusly, coffee is only commercially cultivated in the “coffee belt” which is found between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn (relatively close to the equator) and stretches across the entire globe. We normally group coffees into three main growing regions, the Americas, Africa and Asia/Pacific. Each region can also be divided into sub-regions. The Americas are made up of Central America and South America, Africa includes the Eastern Coast of Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula to Yemen, and Asia/Pacific includes countries in South Eastern Asia and various islands of Indonesia.

 

Each region has its own heritage of coffee cultivation, tradition of planting, harvesting and processing and unique qualities that distinguish them from other regions. After tasting many coffees from a particular region you would probably be able to recognize many of these traits and even be able to guess which region a coffee came from!

 

While coffees from each region have many similarities and qualities that distinguish them from other regions, it should be noted that coffees, regardless of where they come from can vary widely and many coffees even from neighboring farms in the same region can (and often do) taste very differently. Many of these variables can change depending on how a coffee is processed, how the roaster decides to highlight these wonderful characteristics in the roast, and even how long ago the coffee was harvested.

 

We love each region for the different characteristics they bring and love to be surprised by the wonderful and unique traits they have that we never knew we could taste in coffee.

 

We hope that over time you will learn about each of these regions, subregions and countries, find coffees that you like and eventually be able to differentiate coffees based on where it came from.
