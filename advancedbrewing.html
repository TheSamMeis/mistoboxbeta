		<h2>| Water |</h2>
		<p>
Water is an incredibly crucial part of brewing, yet it is usually an afterthought. Think about this, over 98% of the coffee you drink is made up of water. How that water tasted before brewing will definitely affect how the coffee will taste afterwards. Also, chemicals that are present in your water can greatly affect how your coffee will taste.

Purified vs Filtered
For the majority of coffee brewers, filling up the kettle or coffee brewer is as simple as turning on the faucet. Unfortunately, this generally isn’t ideal for coffee brewing for a number of reasons. The water quality from your tap will vary by where you live. If you live in LA, for example, the water is incredible hard and has high concentrations of chemicals that will cause build up in your brewing equipment, in addition to muting most of the delicious, nuanced flavors from your freshly roasted coffee. Even though water from your tap has been treated with chemicals to make it pure, which is to say, it is safe for consumption, it doesn’t mean it will make your coffee shine. Simply put, just because water is ‘pure’, doesn’t make it the best ingredient for brewing. 

By filtering water, we can remove high concentrations of any chemical that would add negative flavors or make your coffee less tasty. For example, too much chlorine in your coffee and it will increase the perception of bitterness. While small amounts of sodium can make your coffee taste sweeter, high concentrations can make it taste sour and unpleasant. 

We recommend water that has been filtered by a Reverse Osmosis (RO) filtration system. This will remove high concentrations of unwanted chemicals (like chlorine, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium) and add in desirable minerals to enhance your coffee’s natural sweetness. 

Since most RO systems can be fairly expensive to install in your home, we recommend buying 1 gallon jugs of water usually labeled “Drinking Water” from a local grocery store for your coffee brewing. This will guarantee that your brewing equipment won’t develop build up over time and that your coffee will be that much more delicious!

Temperature 
Just like baking, coffee brewing is a science. Being aware of how water temperature affects brewing will aid in producing delicious and consistent results brew after brew. 

Have you ever tried to dissolve sugar in room temperature water? How about hot water? 

You’ll notice that sugar in room temperature water doesn’t dissolve very easily, while it dissolves relatively quickly and without much agitation in hot water. This is because water is a better solvent, a liquid capable of dissolving other compounds, at higher temperatures. 

Coffee brewing requires water at high temperatures in order to dissolve those super tasty flavor molecules trapped deep inside the coffee bean known as soluble solids. 

If one brews with water that isn’t hot enough, they won’t be able to pull out enough soluble solids and aromatic compounds (tasty flavor capsules) to produce a good tasting cup. In order to get all those soluble solids we need to brew with water that’s about 200°F. 

Manual brewing easily accomplishes this, as long as you bring your fresh, filtered water to boil immediately before brewing. 

Automatic coffee brewers are a different story, however. Often times, these brewers are made with cheap heating elements that will get water warm, but not hot. So no matter how freshly roasted your coffee is, how even your grounds are from your burr grinder or how perfectly filtered your water is, if you brew with water that’s not hot enough, it still won’t taste good. In order to fix this, we recommend brewing manually with one of these brew methods or using this automatic brewer made by Bonavita, which is one of our favorite way to make coffee for a crowd!

	 	<h2> | Whole Bean Storage| </h2>
	
	 	<p style ="margin-top: 0px">		 	
			While the fridge and freezer may be great for keeping meat and veggies fresh, it can actually be more hurtful than helpful in preserving coffee’s freshness. A coffee bean is almost as porous as a sponge, which means it will absorb any weird or off flavor ruminating in your fridge. It will also be exposed to condensation as the moisture trapped inside will form on the outside of the bean and cause the staling process to accelerate. 

			Air, light, heat and moisture are coffee’s natural enemies, and exposure to them can speed up the staling process, losing those flavors and aromas that make your coffee so tasty. We think that the kitchen cupboard is perfect for storing coffee. 

			Storing whole bean coffee in a dark, airtight container at room temperature can make sure your coffee stays fresh for up to two weeks.

		<h2>| Coffee Freshness |</h2>
		<p>
			We all grew up seeing the red can in the cupboard, the comforting aroma that filled the kitchen every time its seal was lifted, and the brown crystals inside that magically changed our parents into functioning human beings. For most people, coffee is considered more akin to a canned good than a perishable item with a shelf life. 

			While it is true that coffee does not go “bad” in the sense of being unsafe to consume, it does have a shelf life that should be adhered to. We think of coffee almost like produce. It should be acquired fresh, stored properly and used within a short period of time for best results. 

			Why, you say? Simple. Coffee goes stale fairly quickly, and requires proper handling. Once it is roasted, several chemical processes occur that make it susceptible to staling. Firstly, there are gases inside, such as carbon dioxide, that are produced during roasting and will start to evaporate over time. To make matters worse, a number of aromatic compounds (tasty flavor molecules) adhered themselves to these gases during roasting and will disappear with the carbon dioxide. No matter how you store your coffee, these gases will almost completely disperse within about two weeks, and in order to brew the tastiest coffee, you should use it all within that time. Remember that exposure to heat and light will cause these gases to evaporate more quickly. 

			Secondly, coffee needs an airtight container to protect it from the environment. If it is exposed to other flavors or weird smells, it can absorb them and ruin your coffee. If it is stored in a humid environment, condensation can form on the outside of the coffee and ruin your coffee. 

			And finally, coffee has oils. As we know with common household oils like butter or olive oil, they need to be stored properly so that they don’t go rancid. Over time, the oils in coffee will migrate to the outside of the bean, making them more susceptible to rancidification. In order to avoid this, airtight containers are best for keeping oxygen away.

			If you typically buy pre-ground coffee, think again. Whole bean coffee is like a force-field of freshness, once broken it becomes vulnerable. This is because grinding exposes exponential surface area to oxygen (remember those oils we talked about) and it breaks open the cell walls that trap carbon dioxide and aromatic compounds allowing them to escape quite rapidly. Within a few minutes, almost all of these aromatic compounds will have disappeared and the oils in the coffee becomes ever vulnerable to oxygen. Brewing coffee that is ground any more than a few minutes in advance will only produce a cup that has only a fraction of flavor.

			The three T’s
			In coffee brewing, there are a number of variables that can have huge effects on the final cup. Some of the most important of these can be remembered as the “3 T’s”.

			Time: The “contact” or “dwell” time, refers to how long coffee remains in contact with the water. Generally, brewed coffee needs to sit with water for at least 2-3 minutes to fully extract the desired available flavors compounds (water soluble solids). If coffee sits with water for too little time, you risk underextraction, which will result in weak, sour tasting coffee. If coffee sits with water for too much time, you risk overextraction, which will result in harsh, bitter, and astringent tasting coffee. Remember that each brew method has a different ideal brew time that can be affected by grind size, how much coffee will be brewed, water temperature and how much agitation occurs. (Coffee Brewing Basics, Lingle)

			Ideal Contact Time by Brew Method: 
			Espresso: 25 – 30 seconds
			Aeropress: 1 – 3 minutes
			V60 Pour Over: 2.5 – 3 minutes
			Clever Coffee Dripper: 3.5 – 4 minutes
			Chemex: 3.5 – 5 minutes
			French Press: 4 minutes
			Auto-dripper: 6 – 8 minutes
			Cold Brew: 12 – 24 hours

			Temperature: For optimal extraction to take place, water must be roughly 200°F when in contact with the coffee, and stay within the range of 195° - 205°F for the entire duration of brewing. If the water temperature drops below this temperature range during the brewing process, one risks underextraction, resulting in weak, sour tasting coffee. If the water temperature maintains a temperature higher than this during brewing one risks overextraction, resulting in harsh, bitter, and astringent tasting coffee. (Coffee Brewing Basics, Lingle)

			Be mindful that water temperature stays relatively stable when in a large mass, but becomes volatile and can fluctuate easily when that mass is decreased. We recommend bringing a goose-neck spouted kettle filled with filtered water to boil on the stove top immediately prior to brewing. This will ensure that the water is just above 200° when brewing starts and will maintain proper temperature for the entire brewing process. 


			Turbulence: Turbulence, also referred to as “agitation”, is the chaotic mixing of grounds, gases, and hot water during coffee brewing. The main source of turbulence that we can control is agitation caused by an external force. This usually involves the use of a spoon or paddle to stir the coffee and water mixture during brewing. It is important to be aware of the effects of agitation and its potential implications for the resulting extraction. Agitation will accelerate the rate of extraction and improve the uniformity of extraction. This means that the careful and intentional application of agitation will help produce an optimal and even extraction (Everything but Espresso, Rao).  

			We recommend simple, easily repeatable motions when stirring so that you can produce consistent results, brew after brew. (Think 2 or 3 slow and controlled stirs instead of violent and random stirring)
