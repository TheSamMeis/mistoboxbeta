	<p>Coffee can be classified in various groups. Most commonly, we know that coffee can be distinguished as Arabica or Robusta. These are referring to the species of coffee.  Specialty Coffee is made up of coffees that are from the Arabica species. We can classify coffees even further than just by species. These are what are referred to as varieties. 
</p>

<p>
	Just like apples can be classified by their variety, so can coffee. Think about how Granny Smith, Honeycrisp and Pink Lady are all varieties of apples. Each one has certain characteristics that we associate with it. Granny Smith are green and round, medium in size, tart, juicy and great for baking with. Honeycrisp are sweet, larger in size, and have a different texture. 
</p>
<p>
Think about coffee the same way. Each variety has different genetic traits that can determine how a coffee will taste, how much each coffee each shrub can produce every year, how resistant the plant is to disease, and even how tall the shrub can grow. 
</p>

 <p>
	You will sometimes see people use the word 'varietal' to mean 'variety' in coffee. â€œVarietal" is actually a wine term, referring to wines being comprised of only one type of grape variety or labeled 'varietally'. In recent years, the coffee industry has adopted this term, but we prefer to leave it to the wine industry and stick with 'variety'.
</p>
<p>
Knowing the variety of coffee can be an important piece of information that can tell you what flavors you might expect to taste. At MistoBox, we think that knowing the variety is a crucial part of each coffee's story and try to have that information available for every coffee we feature.
